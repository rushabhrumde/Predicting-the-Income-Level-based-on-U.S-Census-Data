# Predicting-the-Income-Level-based-on-U.S-Census-Data

In this project, we analyze U.S. census data taken from the UCI (the University of California at Irvine) Machine Learning Repository, to build a model, which can predict whether the income of a random adult American citizen is less or greater than 50,000$ a year.
